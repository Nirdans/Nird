<dl>

<dt><h4> Domain Name </h4> </dt>

<dd>A domain name (a web address for a website like www.yoursitename.com, www.google.com)</dd>

<dt> <h4> Hosting</h4> </dt>

<dd> Hosting is a service that connects your site to the internet, hosting allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center. </dd>


<p>The WordPress platform itself is absolutely free, but a domain name and hosting will cost you money,on a average domain name per year cost $9 per year, Basic hosting can be bought from as low as $1 per month.

<h3> SETTING UP WORDPRESS SITE</h3>
<p>After you've bought your domain name and set up your hosting, it's time to get your website up and running. The first thing you'll need to do is install WordPress to your domain.</p>

<h3> Installing wordpress </h3>

<p>There are two possible ways to install WordPress <p>
<li> One-Click Installation </li>
<li> Manual Installation</li>

<h4>One-click Installation</h4>
<p>Almost every reliable and well-established hosting company has integrated 1-click installation for WordPress, which makes getting going very easy.<p>

<p>If you signed up with Bluehost or Hostgator or any other similar hosting company, you should find your '1-click installation' in your account control panel.<p>

Here are the steps you should follow (should be similar/same on all the major web hosting companies):
<ol>
 <li>Log in to your hosting account.</li>
 <li>Go to your control panel.</li>
 <li>Look for the "WordPress" icon.</li>
 <li>Choose the domain where you want to install your website.
 Click the "Install Now" button and you should get access to your NEW WordPress website.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Bluehost Control Panel Page</h4>

<h4>Hostgator Control Panel Page</h4>

<h4>Manual Installation</h4>


<p>In some rare case (some hosting companies don't provide one-click-install for WordPress) you don't have the possibility to install WordPress automatically, look this manual guide below <p>

<ol>
<li>Download WordPress from here: http://wordpress.org/download.</li>

<li>Create a new folder on your desktop and unzip WordPress in it.</li>

<li>Look for a file named wp-config-sample.php and rename it to: wp-config.php.</li>

<li>Now open the wp-config.php (with notepad for example) and fill the following lines:

define('DB_NAME', 'database_name_here');  Database name (if you don't know it, ask this from your hosting support)
define('DB_USER', 'username_here');  Your hosting username
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here'); Your hosting password
After you have filled the gaps, save the file.</li>

<li>Now log into your hosting ftp (download FileZilla for that). The FTP address is usually ftp.yourdomain.com, username and password are the same that you used to register to your host.</li>

<li>If there is any file named 'index' - delete it. After that upload all the files from your WordPress folder to your FTP server. You can use "drag n drop function in FileZilla.</li>

<li>Once you have completed the previous steps, go the URL: yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php</li>

</ol>
