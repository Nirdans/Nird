<h2> BUILDING WEBSITES WITH JOOMLA </h2>

<p>Joomla is one of the largest and most famous FREE open source projects next to WordPress, With origins all the way back to 2000, Joomla is responsible for many innovations in the PHP / MySQL space that includes WordPress, Drupal, Magento and so many others.</p>

<p>As Joomla continues to thrive in 2015, Joomla remains the second most popular content management system (CMS), behind only WordPress. Joomla is responsive because the Joomla team decided to adopt the Bootstrap framework. The use of Bootstrap makes Joomla 3 attractive for front-end designers, but it also makes it easy for developers to create interfaces for their code.</p>

<h3> Installing Joomla </h3>

<p>To start building websites with joomla, Domain Registration and Hosting should be done first, to install Joomla - you have two options. For both ways, you'll need a hosting and domain name. </p>


<p>There are two possible ways to install Joomla <p>
<li> One-Click Installation </li>
<li> Manual Installation</li>

<h4> One-Click Installation</h4>

<p>Almost every reliable and well-established hosting company has integrated 1-click installation for Joomla, which makes getting going very easy.<p>


    <img src="file:///android_asset/one_click_joomla.png" alt="Joomla cpanel" ></p>

<p>If you signed up with Bluehost or Hostgator or any other similar hosting company, you should find your '1-click installation' in your account control panel.<p>


<ol>
    <li>Log in to your hosting account.</li>
    <li>Go to your control panel.</li>
    <li>Look for the "One-click Install" icon and click that to proceed.</li>
    <li>Now you'll be redirected to a page where you'd be able to install Joomla for free with one-click-installation</li>

    <br>

    <img src="file:///android_asset/install_joomla.png" alt="Joomla cpanel" ></p>


<li>Once you have clicked on the 'Install' button, you'll be able to choose a domain that you have bought, the white box after / (slash) can be left blank. If you choose to write, something let's say 'Joomla' - your site will be installed to YourNewDomain.com/Joomla. If you leave it blank, it'll be installed straight to your root domain - YourNewDomain.com (recommended option).</li>

<li>Installing Joomla to your domain can take a while (2-10minutes), Once the install has been finished, you'll be able to see the login credentials for your new Joomla website. If you can't see them for some reason, make sure you check the Notification Center.

</li>


</ol>

<h4> Installing Joomla Manually </h4>

<ol>
    <li> Download Joomla from http://www.joomla.org/download.html </li>

    <li> Extract the archived joomla file and Move the downloaded Joomla installation package to the server. Use a FTP Client to transfer the Joomla files to your server. There are several FTP Client available for use, FileZilla is most popular one.</li>


    <li>Now log into your hosting ftp (download FileZilla for that). The FTP address is usually ftp.yourdomain.com, username and password are the same that you used to register to your host.</li>

    <li>If there is any file named 'index' - delete it. After that upload all the files from your Joomla folder to your FTP server. You can use "drag n drop function in FileZilla. The other option is directly uploading the Joomla files in the cpanel File Manager in the Public_html directly .</li>

    <li>Run the Joomla installation wizard. Enter the URL for your site (for example, http://www.your-page.com) in your browser. Or if you uploaded it to a sub-folder, go to: http://yoursite.com/JoomlaFolder/ . It is a 3 step process </li>
    <br>
    <p>It is a 3 step process</p>

    <li> The other important thing in the process is setting up the database, It's smartest to use a MySQL database to install Joomla, but Joomla does also support MySQLi and PostgreSQL.</li>

    <li> In the database Section of the installation, Enter your database's host name, username, password and other required details, Joomla will automatically generate a random table prefix to make the site very much secure </li>

    <br>

    <li> The final installation screen offers you the choice of different sample data. Lower down the page is an overview of your configuration settings. Joomla also checks to make sure that your server is properly set up. If anything needs correcting, it will be marked in red. After Checking everything click Install.</li>

    <br>

    <p>After completing all the steps you will see a progress bar and then a Congratulations! screen to confirm the successful Joomla installation</p>
</ol>

<h3> Joomla Website </h3>
<p> After successfull installation of Joomla to your domain, you'll see a very basic clean site setup like a blog.</p>

<h3> Logging Into Joomla Site </h3>


<p>To access the Admin Interface Add the word /administrator/ to the URL of your site. For example, http://YourNewDomain.com/administrator/</p>

<P>Login using the admin username and password that you created during the installation process. The main toolbar across the top of the screen contains everything you need to manage your site, the Control Panel you see after first logging in contains useful shortcuts and information based on that main toolbar.</p>

<h4> Posting Contents </h4>

To write content in Joomla Website go to the main toolbar, then Content, then Article Manager.

There are only three things you need to do to publish your first article:

<li>Title</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Body text</li>

<p>After entering all the contents, click Save to publish your article.Click your Site Name in the very top left corner of the screen, You'll now see your article published at the top of the homepage.</p>

<h3>Templates & Components </h3>

A template is a type of Joomla extension that changes the way your site looks. There are two types of templates used by the Joomla CMS: Front-end Templates and Back-end Templates. The Front-end Template controls the way your website is presented to the user viewing the website's content. The Back-end Template controls the way your website's administrative tasks are presented for controlling management functions by a Joomla Administrator. These would include common tasks such as: user, menu, article, category, module, component, plugin and template management. The template can be accessed from main toolbar, go to Extensions, then Template Manager.


<h4> Components </h4>
<p>A component is a kind of Joomla extension. Components are the main functional units of Joomla; they can be seen as mini-applications. An easy analogy would be that Joomla is the operating system and the components are desktop applications. Created by a component, content is usually displayed in the center of the main content area of a template (depending on the template).</p>

<p>Most components have two main parts: an administrator part and a site part. The site part is what is used to render pages of your site when they are requested by your site visitors during normal site operation. The administrator part provides an interface to configure and manage different aspects of the component and is accessible through the Joomla administrator application.</p>

<h3> Joomla Extension </h3>
<p>An extension is a software package that extends your Joomla! installation in some way. A small selection of extensions is included with the default Joomla! installation but many more are available from http://extensions.joomla.org.</p>

<p>There are now about 9000 extensions in categories from 'Access & Security' to 'Style & Design'. The directory's full name is the Joomla Extension Directory, or the JED for short.</p>

<p>One major difference between the JED and the WordPress plugin directory is that any extension can be listed, regardless of whether or not they have a free version. So, it's fair to say that the JED really does contain every Joomla extension worth using.</p>

<img src="file:///android_asset/joomla_categories.png" alt="Joomla cpanel" ></p>

<p>The JED has an active review and rating system.

    Some of the most popular extensions on the directory have 100's of reviews and each one is rated according for its functionality, ease of use, documentation and support.</p>
